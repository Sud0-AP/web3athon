## Features

### Tokenization of Real Estate 
Our project aims to tokenize real estate properties into crypto tokens, enabling multiple people to invest in them. Each property is represented by a specially modified ERC-721 token, ensuring its uniqueness and authenticity.

### Investing with Crypto Tokens

By buying these tokens, users can invest in real estate with low sums of money. The price of the tokens is dynamically updated based on the property's current market value. This allows for greater accessibility and flexibility in real estate investments.

### DAO-based Decision Making


Our platform incorporates a DAO-based model for each property, where users can actively participate in decision-making processes. They can approve or deny various aspects related to property maintenance, such as approving renters or sellers. Users can even collectively update the token price according to the current market rate.

### Transparency and Security


With the transparency and security of blockchain technology, our project ensures that all transactions and decisions are recorded and visible to everyone. This provides a level of trust and accountability that traditional real estate investments often lack.
